#' @title Compute spatial robust-design log likelihood given estimated activity center locations. Use this 
#' during the  "M" step of the EM algorithm
#' 
#'  @description Given a set of activity center locations, this routine computes the 
#'  spatial robust design likelihood for a set of coefficients.  
#'  
#' @param beta A named vector of coefficient estimates.  
#' Names and number of elements should be as follows:  
#' . "surv?" (survival) = (nprimary-1) elements corresponding to intervals between primary occasions
#' . "gp?" (gamma prime, emigration) = (nprimary-1) elements corresponding to intervals between primary occasions.
#' . (Optional) "gpp?" (gamma prime prime, immigration) = (nprimary - 2) elements corresponding to intervals between 
#'    2nd primary and the last.  Recall there is no immigration parameter for the interval between primary 1 and 2. 
#' . "D?" (density) = nprimary elements. 
#' . "g0?" (capture probability at traps) = nprimary elements
#' . "sigma?" (capture probability width) = nprimary elements.
#' 
#' Current implementation allows constant or complete time variation (small t).  For constant model, 
#' beta has length 5 or 6 (6 if Markov emigration). For small t model, length of beta is either (5*nprimary - 2) or
#' (6*nprimary - 4).  
#' For example, in a problem with 4 primaries and 5 secondaries in each primary, and no gpp elements, beta 
#' should have length 18 = 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 and be named \code{c("surv1", "surv2", surv3", "gp1", "gp2",     
#' "gp3", "D1", "D2", "D3", "D4", "g01", "g02", "g03", "g04", "sigma1", "sigma2", "sigma3", "sigma4")}.  Note that 
#' order does not matter because elements are all named. 
#' If length of \code{beta} is 5*nprimary - 2, this routine assume that the 'random emigration' 
#' model is being fitted wherein emigration probability (gp) and immigration 
#' probability (gpp) are equal. If  \code{length(beta)} equals 6*nprimary - 4, this routine assumes the 
#' 'Markov emigration' model is being fitted 
#' wherein emigration (gp) and immigration (gpp) depend upon whether an individual is on or off the 
#' study area (see robust design literature for more details). 
#'
#' @parm ac.locs A nan X nprimary X 2 array of estimated activity center locations.  
#' \code{ac.locs[i,j,]} = c(x,y) = coordinates of activity center for animal i
#' during primary occasion j.  It is assumed that all locations are in valid habitat, so no checking against the 
#'  habitat mask is performed here.
#'  
#' @param ch A 3-D array of capture histories.  Size is nan X nprim X nsecondaries.  Missing secondaries 
#' are specified with columns of all NA's (i.e., if the 4th secondary of the ith primary was not done, 
#' \code{all(is.na(ch[,i,4])) == TRUE}).  Cells in the array contain trap number that caught the individual.
#' Trap numbers are rows in the \code{traps} matrix. ch[i,j,k] = 0 if animal i was uncaptured during 
#'     secondary occasion k of primary occasion j. ch[i,j,k] = x (where x integer > 0) means animal i was captured 
#'     during secondary occasion k of primary occasion j in trap x which has coordinates \code{traps[[j]][[k]][x,]}.
#' 
#' @param traps Either a \code{SpatialPoints} object, or a list of lists containing trap locations for each secondary. 
#' If \code{traps} is a \code{SpatialPoints} object, it is assumed that all traps were "on" during all secondary occasions (recall secondary
#' occasions are embedded in primary occasions).  If \code{traps} is a list of lists, it is assumed that the locations 
#' of "on" traps varied amoungst secondary occasions. In this case, the each element in the first layer of 
#' lists is a sub-lists of "on" trap locations 
#' for each primary occasion.  Each element in the second layer of lists is either a matrix or a \code{SpatialPoints} object of 
#' trap locations "on" during a secondary of a 
#' particular primary. In other words,
#' \code{length(traps)} is the number of primary occasions. 
#' \code{length(traps[[i]])} is number of secondaries during the i-th primary.  \code{traps[[i]][[j]]} is either a T(i,j) X 2 matrix
#' or a SpatialPoints object containing T(i,j) trap locations that were "on" during the j-th secondary occasion of the i-th primary. The trap location that caught 
#' animal m during the j-th secondary of the i-th primary is \code{traps[[i]][[j]][ch[m,i,j],]}.
#' 
#'  @param hab.mask A SpatialPixels or SpatialGrid object (or their *DataFrame analogs) containing allowable locations for activity centers. 
#'    Exactly like masks in the SECR package, \code{hab.mask} defines the outer limit of integration, defines 
#'    sites that are habitat and thus can be occupied, descritizes habitat covariates for use in models.
#'    The current implementation does not allow the habitat mask to change between primaries or secondaries. 
#'    The mask is constant throughout the study.  
#'    Note that the area of each pixel (grid cell) is computed
#'    as \code{prod(hab.mask@grid@cellsize)}, so \code{hab.mask} must be projected (e.g., in UTM's) 
#'    and coordinates in \code{traps} must be in the same units.  Resulting density estimates 
#'    are number of animals per squared unit of this system.  E.g., if using UTM coordinates in 
#'    units of kilometers, density comes out as inidividuals per square kilometer. 
#'     
#'  @return The spatial (SECR) log likelihood. Note, at very last, log likelihood is 
#'  multiply by -1 so this routine actually returns the negative of the log likelihood.  
#'  This is done so that optim() can minimize and hessian estimation is correct.
#'  
#'  @details   This routine using the notation of Borchera and Efford (2008) "Spatially 
#'  Explicit Maximum Likelihood Methods for Captureâ€“Recapture Studies", Biometrics, v64, 377-385.
#'
#' Another paper, with some ommisions I think, is "Density Estimation by spatially explicit 
#' capture-recapture: likelihood-based methods", by Efford, Borchers, and Byrom. This is unpublished, I think.
#' Either I don't fully comprehend, or this paper has some ommisions and is therefore less helpful. 
#' This paper is for the homogenous Poisson case only.
#'  
#' Eventually, the \code{ch} array should be 
#'     a SpatialPointDataFrame where points are coordinates of traps where each 
#'     animal was caught and data frame contains animalID and occasion of capture. From
#'     that info, we could construct this ch matrix.
